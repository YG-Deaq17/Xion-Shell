In the Xion Shell Version 2.1 update,
Many errors, bugs and inconsistencies with the idea were corrected.
This was done and fixed:
- The xion.net network has been updated. Now to connect to it you need to enter
   “—connect localhost//xion.net”. Also added methods to the network “get” and “viewer”.
- Updated “—stat” command.
- Documentation updated.
- Partial Russification of some commands, but it is still advisable to know English
- The “—grph” command has been reworked. Now you will be given 14 to choose from
   various animations for testing the graphical component in the shell,
   accordingly, the slower and more inhibited the animation is,
   the weaker your GPU is.
- Added a question before exiting the shell by entering commands
   “—exit” or “—quit”. In case of incorrect input in the answer field,
   a memory refresh animation will occur and the shell will reboot.
- Many bugs and shortcomings have been fixed.
